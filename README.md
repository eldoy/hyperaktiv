# Hyperactiv

Reactive data structures based on proxies.

This is a fork of the [hyperactiv](https://github.com/elbywan/hyperactiv) reactive library.

### Install

```
npm i hyperaktiv
```

It is modified to support CommonJS and has removed everything that isn't just the reactive part.

MIT licensed. Enjoy!
